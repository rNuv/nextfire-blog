## Technologies
The React in the front end directly connects with Firebase backend services, removing the need for a middle API. User auth is handled by Firebase using OAuth 2.0 and Google sign in. Next.js handles data retrieval, allowing for server side rendering so cliend facing content can be bot and search engine friendly. Vercel allows for easy deployment and CI/CD.
